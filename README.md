# Online-Shopping-Forecasting

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset 

- In this project, I attempt to predict whether browsing sessions on an e-commerce site by users will successfully convert into purchase and generate revenue, based on various properties of the browsing session. 

- To accomplish this, I have performed exploratory analysis on the dataset, conduct necessary preprocessing work, train several classification models, including __logistic regression, K-NN, Kernel soft-margin support vector machine and neural networks__, and finally evaluate the performances of each model to pick out the best one.    

- The NN model was built using TensorFlow while other algorithms were write directly __only use NumPy__.
